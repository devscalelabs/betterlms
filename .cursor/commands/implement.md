I'd like to you to implement the following feature:

<guidelines>
- Implement the feature in the minimal form as possible.
- Use my own pattern and code structure.
- Keep it simple and easy to understand.
- Code Readability is important more than clever code.
- Do not create barrel files for frontend.
</guidelines>

<important>
- Do not use Any type.
- Always check the linter
- If you create new pages, make sure you add into the route.
- Do not create markdown for guide or example files.
</important>

Now implement the feature.
